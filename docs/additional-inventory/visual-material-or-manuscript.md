# Visual material or manuscript?

It can be difficult, if not impossible, to say for sure whether certain items are manuscripts or visual material. In many ways, the issue stems from categories within collections management and is not the item's fault. This state of things is further complicated by the individual situations and practices of an institution.&#x20;

Still, a decision must be made in order to progress the different strands of inventory. It follows that we start from a point of acknowledging that any decision primarily is pragmatic, and prefer whichever decision causes the least extra effort in reassigning or reinterpreting an item. In inventory, we would not reassign an item that is already defined as either manuscript or visual material.

For manuscript inventory, we proceed on the basis of the following guidelines:

* If there are any CC numbers present on the item: It is visual material.
* If there is no text and no CC: It is visual material.

We want to avoid a level of fresh description that sits closer to cataloguing than inventory. In cases where the acquisition history of an item is unclear, and the item for instance presents as scattered, illustrated folia from what may or may not have been conceived as a gathered manuscript, the choice of category can imply a level of information or knowledge about the item that we do not actually have.
