# Overview

This Page gives an overview of our work with manuscript cataloguing using TEI, manuscript inventory, and related workflows. It is, at time of writing, primarily intended as:

* A 'everything in one place' page to store the range of documentation and engagement work developed so far.
* A drafting space for the evolving TEI and inventory documentation.
