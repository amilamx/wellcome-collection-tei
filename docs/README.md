# Overview

This page gives an overview of our work with manuscript cataloguing using TEI, manuscript inventory, and related workflows. It is, at time of writing, primarily intended as:

* A 'everything in one place' page to store the range of documentation and engagement work developed so far.
* A drafting space for the evolving TEI and inventory documentation.

Note that this GitBook synchs with the [docs](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcome-collection-tei/tree/main/docs) folder within the Wellcome Collection TEI GitHub repository. The [FrontEnd](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcome-collection-tei/tree/main/docs/frontend) folder is in active use by several teams, and so we do not edit it here.

Parts of the information on this GitBook is collated from documents previously circulated internally at Wellcome Collection.
