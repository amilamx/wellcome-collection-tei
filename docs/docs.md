# Wellcome Collection TEI Manual and Documentation

This folder contains the most up-to-date version of the _Manual for TEI at Wellcome Collection_ in PDF format.

The manual is not meant to be a detailed introduction to the msDesc schema, but rather an out-of-the-box introduction to TEI for manuscript cataloguing at Wellcome Collection.

Earlier versions are stored in the OldVersions folder.

For GitBook readers, the link to the PDF of the manual is [here](TEI\_Manual\_2020\_V1.pdf).
