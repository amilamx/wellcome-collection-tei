# Minor amendments to MSS

Very valuable amendments to our cataloguing records come from a variety of sources, ranging from our readers to the different ongoing workstreams. The manner of incorporating these amendments to the cataloguing record will depend on the following variables:

* What is the current cataloguing status for the manuscript?
  * Does it sit in Sierra, Calm, TEI, a print catalogue, elsewhere?
  * If not in TEI, can a minimum viable TEI description be done?
    * This may depend on the complexity of the amendment, as well as any particular challenges involved in the manuscript itself
