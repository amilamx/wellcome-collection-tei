# Sensitivity

Wellcome Collection is committed to maximising public access to the full range of its collections, in keeping with its [Access Policy](https://wellcomecollection.cdn.prismic.io/wellcomecollection/d4817da5-c71a-4151-81c4-83e39ad4f5b3\_Wellcome+Collection\_Access+Policy\_Aug+2020.pdf), whilst also ensuring that we behave lawfully, ethically and responsibly, in line with our evolving [sensitivity guidelines](https://wellcomecollection.cdn.prismic.io/wellcomecollection/86cda736-bfa1-44f2-bdda-11345632ce27\_Wellcome+Collection+Access+Procedures+January+2022.pdf).

In the context of manuscript inventory, it is especially relevant to separate between what might be coined _primary_ and _secondary_ sensitivities. The wording here is not meant to imply a hierarchy of sensitivities, but rather to draw on the similar distinction between primary and secondary source material.

## Primary sensitivities

Primary sensitivities cover any element of sensitivity that appears directly within the manuscript material itself. Given the range and complexity of the manuscript collections, keeping a record of these sensitivities might fall beyond the scope of manuscript inventory and rather be a task for research into these collections.

## Secondary sensitivities

These cover sensitivities concerning the provenance, acquisition, or custodial history of items, and should be noted where possible.
