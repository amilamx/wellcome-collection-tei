# Phase 2

Phase 2 of Manuscript Inventory begins by distinguishing between two general workflows:

* Inventory by TEI
* Inventory by the shelf

Regardless of the workflow, Phase 2 records the following fields for every manuscript:

![Fields recorded for Phase 2 of Manuscript Inventory.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-06-28 at 15.53.54.png>)

These fields cover, but are not limited to, the minimum viable record of the Spectrum standard:

· Unique object number

· Object name

· Number of objects

· Basic description

· Current location

· Current owner

· Recorder and recording date for this information

In addition, we record, where known, where the manuscript might be catalogued, its condition, and further elements.
