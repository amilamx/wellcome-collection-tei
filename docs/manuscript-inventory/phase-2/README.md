# Phase 2

Phase 2 of Manuscript Inventory begins by distinguishing between two general workflows:

* Inventory by TEI
* Inventory by the shelf

Regardless of the workflow, Phase 2 records the following fields for every manuscript:

![Fields recorded for Phase 2 of Manuscript Inventory.](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-06-28 at 15.53.54.png>)

These fields cover, but are not limited to, the minimum viable record of the Spectrum standard:

· Unique object number

· Object name

· Number of objects

· Basic description

· Current location

· Current owner

· Recorder and recording date for this information

In addition, we record, where known, where the manuscript might be catalogued, its condition, and further elements.

**Unique object number**&#x20;

Main identifier

All items that are either fully or partially catalogued will be assigned a main identifier as its unique object number. This is usually adapted from either the title or shelfmark and follows the format overall collection \[MS], individual collection, sequential number  e.g., MS Arabic 1.

Temporary Numbers

Uncatalogued items will be assigned unique temporary numbers in line with archive accreditation and the other Wellcome inventories. Temporary numbers are recorded on Quickbase and are written in pencil on flags and attached to the item. The format for unique temporary numbers is MSS.INVYEAR/sequential number e.g., MSS.INV2022/1.&#x20;

**Accession number**

Any accession numbers found on manuscripts during the inventory will be recorded. These numbers are a good starting point for investigating provenance of items in our collections. We should record these numbers for catalogued and uncatalogued material and if there are multiple numbers, these should be recorded and separated by the use of a semi colon.

**Other number**&#x20;

Any other numbers will also be recorded during phase 2 of the inventory. These numbers are a good starting point for investigating provenance of items in our collections. We should record these numbers for catalogued and uncatalogued material and if there are multiple numbers, these should be recorded and separated by the use of a semi colon.
