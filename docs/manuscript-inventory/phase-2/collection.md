# Collection

The manuscripts collection is divided into smaller collections mostly based on language. This is reflected in how they are catalogued and assigned identifiers. All catalogued manuscripts should be allocated to a collection. Some uncatalogued manuscripts will also have a collection, if this is available it should be added to the inventory. The collection is selected from the drop-down menu on Quickbase or added to the menu if the option is not yet there.&#x20;

## Exemptions

There are some cases of manuscripts that are part of two collections. These are part of the Western manuscript series but are also catalogued as another separate collection. for example, the Greek collection and the Spanish collection. In these cases all appropriate collections should selected from the drop-down menu.&#x20;
