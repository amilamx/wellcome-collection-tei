# Condition

Recording the physical condition of a manuscript is important in providing Collection Care with a list of unstable items and ensuring that manuscripts can be cared for correctly. In inventory the focus is on the stability of the item and its suitability for consultation. The inventory uses the below letters to grade an items condition.&#x20;

* **A**- No work required. Pristine, or already conserved or rebound items. Items that at time of assessment require no conservation
* **B**- Good. Stable, suitable for all library uses i.e. exhibition, copying, consultation. Only very minor damage such as localised surface dirt, and very minor tears for example. No part of the item is in a vulnerable state.
* **C**- Fair. Stable although damaged. Suitable for consultation. For example damage may include tears and some loss but the item is not inherently unstable.
* **D**- Poor. Unstable items. At risk of further damage under normal consultation. For example extensive structural problems including - embrittlement, mechanical damage, mould damage, risk of loss and further deterioration.
*   **E**- Bad. Highly unstable items. Not suitable for consultation. For example major mould infestation, blocking, extensive fragmentation, high fragility.&#x20;

    Highly valuable items where producing them to readers would put them at risk of unacceptable damage.

Anyone doing manuscripts inventory should first have a handling training session with conservation to ensure manuscripts are handled appropriately.&#x20;
