description: Information for collections in TEI

# By TEI

Manuscript collections that have been catalogued using TEI have increased visibility and accessibility through Wellcomeâ€™s online catalogue. Most of this work has been done remotely without consulting the physical manuscript. Therefore, ensuring the physical items match their metadata, are retrievable and are not at risk from handling is a priority.

Inventory by TEI  follows the same workflow as Inventory by collection, but uses the information captured in TEI files to populate inventory fields in Quickbase.
