# Inventory by location or by collection

## Inventory by collection

Manuscripts that have been catalogued can be inventoried collection by collection. Inventory by collection begins by consulting a collections calalogue information and ends in viewing the manuscripts in their physical location. This can be helpful in ascertaining a fuller understanding of the state of a whole collection. However, a single collection can be dispersed across multiple locations which can complicate the process.&#x20;

## Inventory by location

Inventory by location starts by being in the physical location of a manuscript then finding it's catalogue information. This workflow is for uncatalogued and catalogued items. However, the disparities in cataloguing and scattered nature of information, can be challenging. Multiple collections can be stored in the same location, for example the plan chests, which can mean jumping between collections.

See [Cataloguing status](../cataloguing-status.md) for more information.&#x20;

All manuscripts on Sierra have been imported into Quickbase and should be discoverable by searching their identifier within the Individual Manuscripts database.&#x20;

See [Imports](../../../additional-inventory/imports.md) for further information.&#x20;
