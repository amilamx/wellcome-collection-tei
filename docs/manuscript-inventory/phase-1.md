# Phase 1

Since many manuscript collections have individual items dispersed across the Planchest drawers, and the drawers themselves are commonly used for manuscript-related items (such as single leaves mounted for exhibitions), the first step towards manuscript inventory has been to survey these drawers.

Planchest inventory simply records the entire contents of every single Planchest drawer.

![The fields recorded for every Planchest drawer.](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-06-28 at 15.45.35.png>)

Especially noteworthy points about these fields:

* **Condition** here refers to the condition of the items within the drawer as a whole. For instance:
  * Are they too many in one drawer?
  * Are they too tightly stored?
  * Are they too large for the drawer?
  * Are they in a state that needs Conservation attention?\

*   **Drawer Contents on Catalogue** is not always possible to answer in situ. The following options are given to reflect this:

    * Yes - All items are catalogued
    * No - All items are uncatalogued
    * Partially- Some items are catalogued
    * TBD- Unsure, needs further investigation


* **Material Type** recognises that there is a wide variety of material stored in the planchests, not solely manuscripts, some of which are not well documented. The following options are given:
  * Archive
  * EPB
  * Manuscript
  * Other/Misc
  * Visual
