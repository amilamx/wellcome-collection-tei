# Manuscript Inventory

Manuscript inventory is an iterative process that begins by acknowledging the following challenges:

* Manuscript collections are physically dispersed, with parts of series and single manuscripts, for a variety of reasons, moved and stored across a variety of spaces.
* Catalogue sources for the manuscript collections are not uniform. Some collections only have PDF or print catalogues and no Sierra or Calm presence, some only have dummy entries in Sierra, and some are scattered across different cataloguing efforts, published or internally circulated.

The following documentation for Phases 1 and 2 of manuscript inventory situates our work within these challenges. I am currently editing this, with not much purpose to my edits.
