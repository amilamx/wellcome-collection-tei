The collection has been catalogued in 3 stages:

* Manuscripts 18-25 were catalogued in c.2005 by R. Kidane.
* Manuscripts 1-25 were re-catalogued and manuscripts 26 and 27 were catalogued in 2015 by Ekaterina Gusarova. 

The TEI files in this repository were created by members of teams from across Wellcome Collection.
