# Wellcome Collection's Manuscripts in Arabic

Wellcome Collection are contributors to the [FIHRIST](https://www.fihrist.org.uk/) union catalogue from the Islamicate world. This folder contains local copies of the FIHRIST descriptions. More manuscript descriptions will be added to FIHRIST in due course.
