            <note resp="#U32006468">Hi JannyP,
You used the closed tag for line breaks where &quot;Sufficiently&quot; breaks across the line.
I think the particular convention for that would be this one.
Hope it helps!
&quot;Line Breaks: Hit return once after each line ends. Two returns indicate a new entry/paragraph break. If a word breaks across a line, place the hyphen, equal sign, or other word splitting character in a soft break tag:&quot;
So there would be a dash between the &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot; after &quot;no&quot;</note>
            <note resp="#U220513">Hello Stittches - Thank you very much for that. As you could probably tell I was having great difficulty understanding the Transcription Convention for hyphenated words at the end of a line! Nice explanation. Thank you Jannyp</note>
